    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Read Later is a fictional service designed to allow users to bookmark webpages they want to read later.  It has been designed to follow general good practices within
        coding and to test your knowledge of these.  Thesolution uses a multi tiered approach, with POCO entities being used to represent objects in the system and a service layer to handle all functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>Visual Studio 2019 solution</h3>
    <p>
        The solution consists of 4 projects:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>Data</h5>
            The data project handles the communication with the database and is using Entity Framework (Code first approach).
            Migrations are enabled already - to initialise your database you will need to enter a connection string to Sql Server in appsettings.json, then in package manager console ensure that Data is the selected project and
            enter the command update-database.  this will create the database (if it is not there already), and generate the tables based on the existing entities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Entities</h5>
            The Entities project contains the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_CLR_Object" target="_BLANK">POCO</a> classes that represent the system objects. 
        </li>       
        <li>
            <h5>Services</h5>
            Services expose the functionality to the UI layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>MVC</h5>
            The web layer is an .net core 5 MVC project using the standard templates provided.  It uses standard .net core 5 Dependency Injection 
        </li>
    </ul>
